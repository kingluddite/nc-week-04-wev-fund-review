    <h2>Differences between Modals, Alerts, and Tooltips and Popovers</h2>

      <h3>Modals</h3>
      <p>Modals are different from alerts and tooltips and popovers in a few key ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Disruptive User Experience:</strong> Modals are more disruptive to the user experience. When a modal
          is launched, it takes over the entire screen and prevents the user from interacting with the rest of the page.
          This makes modals ideal for important tasks, such as collecting user input or displaying important
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Content:</strong> Modals can be more complex. Modals can contain a variety of content,
          including text, images, forms, and other interactive elements. This makes them ideal for displaying complex
          information or allowing users to perform complex tasks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Alerts and Tooltips and Popovers</h3>
      <p>Alerts and tooltips and popovers are less disruptive to the user experience. When an alert or tooltip is
        displayed, the user can still interact with the rest of the page. This makes them ideal for displaying short,
        important messages or providing additional information about a specific element on the page.</p>
