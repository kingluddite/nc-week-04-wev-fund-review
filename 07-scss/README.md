# What is difference between CSS and Sass?

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are both used for styling web pages, but there are significant differences between the two:

1. **Syntax**:

   - **CSS:** CSS uses a simple, straightforward syntax with curly braces `{}` and semicolons `;` to define styles. It's a plain text format that is easy to understand.
   - **Sass:** Sass offers a more complex and feature-rich syntax. It allows nesting of rules, the use of variables, mixins, functions, and more. The syntax is designed to make writing and maintaining stylesheets easier and more organized.

2. **Variables**:

   - **CSS:** CSS doesn't have native support for variables. Repeated values need to be manually updated if you want to make changes across your stylesheet.
   - **Sass:** Sass allows you to define variables, which can hold values that you can reuse throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to maintain and update your styles.

3. **Nesting**:

   - **CSS:** CSS doesn't support the nesting of rules within other rules. In CSS, you must write selectors that fully qualify the elements.
   - **Sass:** Sass supports nesting, allowing you to write more organized and readable styles by nesting rules within other rules.

4. **Mixins**:

   - **CSS:** CSS doesn't have mixins. To reuse sets of styles, you'd have to duplicate the properties.
   - **Sass:** Sass provides mixins, which are reusable blocks of styles that can be included within other rules. This promotes cleaner and more maintainable code.

5. **Functions**:

   - **CSS:** CSS doesn't support functions to manipulate values dynamically.
   - **Sass:** Sass includes functions that allow you to perform operations on values, making it easier to calculate values or apply conditional styles.

6. **File Organization**:

   - **CSS:** In CSS, you typically create separate files for different components or sections of your website, which can lead to larger numbers of external CSS files.
   - **Sass:** Sass allows you to modularize your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable files and then compile them into a single CSS file, reducing the number of HTTP requests.

7. **Readability and Maintainability**:

   - **CSS:** Large and complex CSS files can become hard to maintain and read, especially when dealing with multiple levels of selectors.
   - **Sass:** The improved syntax and features in Sass, such as nesting, variables, and mixins, make the code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.

8. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - **CSS:** All web browsers support CSS since it's the standard styling language for the web.
   - **Sass:** Sass is a preprocessor, and the browser doesn't understand it directly. You need to compile Sass code into CSS before it can be used in a web page.

In practice, Sass is often used by web developers to write and organize CSS more efficiently, and then the Sass code is compiled into standard CSS for use on the web. This process allows developers to leverage the benefits of Sass while still delivering CSS to web browsers.
